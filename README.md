## Crypto-Native Product Builder (Solana)

I design and ship complete crypto-native systems — from architecture and on-chain integrations to functional user interfaces.

---

### What I Build

- End-to-end Web3 products
- Solana-integrated systems
- DeFi & execution tooling
- Automation frameworks
- Subscription & monetization systems
- Infrastructure-ready deployments

---

### Capabilities

- System architecture & product design
- Backend systems & APIs
- Web interfaces & client integrations
- On-chain data & protocol interactions
- Deployment & production setup

---

### Focus

I prioritize functional, monetizable systems over theoretical implementations.

---

Open to crypto-native collaborations and system builds.
